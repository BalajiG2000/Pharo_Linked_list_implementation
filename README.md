## Pharo Linked list implementation
The linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.

Step by step method of creating a new class

*Launch the Pharo image from the Virtual Machine.

*Open the system browser by navigating to Browse-> System Brower on the top navigation bar. Alternatively, you can use CTRL+O+B as shortcut for the same.

*The first column is the list of all the packages installed in the current version of Pharo. Right Click on any package and then click on new package for creating a new package on your own.

*Define your class below to create the class. Similarly create the methods for the same.

*This Linkedlist class contains two fields, data and nextlink to store the value of each node and the info of the next node respectively.

*I have created another basiclinkedlist class to link a node one after other. This process would result in our final linked list which stores data continuously and has links in single direction. Also, maintaining links on the both side, i.e front and back will result in the creation of Doubly Linkedlist.
